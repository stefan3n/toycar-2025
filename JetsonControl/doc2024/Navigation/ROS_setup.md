# ROS setup

### We used ROS1 not ROS2 because Cartographer wasn't updated to ROS2. Different Ubuntu versions will require different ROS versions.
### If you are running on **Jetson Nano Orin** you have Ubuntu 20, which requires ROS noetic. **Jetson Nano** has Ubuntu 18 and the ROS version is melodic.

### Follow the installation guide: [melodic](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu) and [noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu).
