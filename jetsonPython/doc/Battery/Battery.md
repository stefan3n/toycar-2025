# The Battery

### The battery pack that powers the robot consist of 30 Li-ION Panasonic NCR18650B cells. (cell characteristics: 3.6V 3350mAh 6.7A). The configuration of the battery is 10s3p. (10 series, 3 parallel). So the total nominal voltage is 36V, the total capacity is 10050 mAh and the maximum current is 20.1 A.

### In order to help with the heat dissipation we used Wurth thermally conductive material.
### To help with the monitoring of the state of the battery we use a generic display.
### Overcurrent protection is ensured by a Schneider Electric Easy9 circuit breaker.
### Overall protection is ensured by a case which is made at CNC from aluminum.

### Charging of the battery pack is done using an old HP laptop charger (200W,  19.5V) together with a DC-DC 600W bust, to convert the voltage to 40v.
