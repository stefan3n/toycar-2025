# Driver and Stepper
## We have a DM422C driver and a stepper with a gearbox. The driver is connected to a 19V power source. Because the stepper has a gearbox, it is capable of microstepping. The microstepping is set by the driver and we actually have a multiplication factor of 1/60. To move the stepper you need to set the direction (write with digitalWrite value HIGH for left and LOW for right) and set the enable pin with HIGH value. To actually move the stepper you need to write in PULL pin HIGH value, introduce the delay , write in PULL pin LOW value and introduce another delay.**Be cautious of this problem, if the time is too short it is a chance to receive an error, a fact marked by a noise from the driver.** In my case the time value is $$\color{red}500 microseconds$$.
### A good advice is to determine the number of steps necessary for the stepper to make a complete rotation. In this way you can command the stepper giving an angle to rotate and after calculate the number of steps that are necessary.
###### If you want to move the stepper faster then you have 2 options: reduce the delay time (but if you make it too small you will recieve an error) or reduce the micro-stepping.
