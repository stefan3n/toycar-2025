# H Bridge
###	We use the L298N H bridge to command the actuators. For this driver you should be cautious about connections. Also this should have a power supply which can handle an electrical current around 2-3 amperes (because the one actuator can need sometimes 2.5-2.6 amperes). Otherwise the actuators will not move and the driver will heat up too much. If the H Bridge has a short circuit it will make a noise (not powerful, but if you listen closely you will hear it).
