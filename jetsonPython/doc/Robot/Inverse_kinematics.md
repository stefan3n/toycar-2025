# Inverse kinematics
### For a manipulator we have two degrees of freedom. In inverse kinematics as input we have the end effector( the final position for manipulator) and the scope is to find out the angles of the manipulator elements such that I reach the required point. To solve inverse kinematics I use the solution presented in this [link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320674833_Kinematics_of_a_Robotic_Manipulator), where I calculate the angles. Because I donâ€™t have rotary engines I also apply some mathematics calculus. I used the formula to calculate the angles and after that I determined how much I should extend the actuators. After this I do some measurements: distance from the join to the position where the actuator vector intersects the link (the actuators are in their initial position). In this way I calculate the positions for x and y (distance from the bottom link to the object and the height of the object).  To determine how much to extend the actuators I do some calculations in Arduino ( I do some simplifications to get the formula without any trigonometric or inverse trigonometry functions in the final formula). Also in jetson we calculate the angle of the front of the car where the object is. When I move the arm, first I rotate it and after this I move the actuators because the actuators move too fast and the stepper doesn't have enough time to arrive at the needed position.
